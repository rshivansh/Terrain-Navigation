# Terrain-Navigation
Code for project work - eYRC IIT-Bombay

This work is part of the e- Yantra Competition conducted by IIT-Bombay 2016-2017 !

Terrain navigation is one of the important challenges in robotic technology. One of the many prerequisites for a robot rover is the ability to navigate a pre-explored terrain. These tasks involve complex challenges like image processing and path planning.
Navigating through a pre-explored or unexplored area is very much like navigating through a maze of connected passages. The following task will be an exercise in understanding these concepts. This task consists of 2 sections: Section 1, Section 2. You have to follow the instructions and complete the sections in a sequential manner. 

## Task - 1
### Section â€“ 1

In this section we have mazes of the following type:

Cells are numbered in a maze using a coordinate system as given below:

Given such a maze, the problem is to navigate from a START location in the maze to an END
location, where the coordinates of START and END have been given.

The expected output should be as follows :

### Section -2

In this section, you are supposed to find out how to represent a full maze in form of an undirected graph in python.
An undirected graph is a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional. An undirected graph is sometimes called an undirected network. In contrast, a graph where the edges point towards specified directions is called a directed graph.
